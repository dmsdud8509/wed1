Take a look around the choice is yours
I'll open up the door
I wanna hear you call my name, my girl
You gotta believe I love you more
</p>
<p style ="margin-top:40px">
Spend my time trying to figure out
How I can get close to you
No don't you ever look away, my girl
You take me on a trip, you make me high
</p>
<p>
(Try me), love the way that your hair, it flows and it flows
Don't hesitate, grab hold, take a chance now
When I see you smiling, I just want you more
Stay with me tonight, can't let you go
</p>
Che, Che, Che, Cherry, Cherry, Oh！ Cherry, Cherry
Won't you give me just one more kiss
I just wanna be the one. Whenever I feel your touch
I can't stop I just love you more, Oh！
Che, Che, Che, Cherry, Cherry, Oh！ Cherry, Cherry
Your secrets are safe to tell
Please let me be your everything 'cause I need you so
